 *     [ ] Add page after
 *     [ ] Add page before
 *     [ ] Delete page
 * [ ] Will need a bit of "file format"
 *     - Still honors the one-image-one-audio policy.
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] HTML5 starts
 * [ ] Generate time-lapse videos
 *
 * ......
 * 
 * [ ] GridView showing previews and titles of Stories for StoryListActivity
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Add UI for using any image on device (copy over)
 * [ ] Add UI for using any audio on device (copy over)
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Usability features
 *     [ ] Fading: during playback, controls disappear after a certain delay (e.g. 5 seconds); otherwise stays
 *     [ ] Show draggable progress bar.
 *         [ ] For audio?

 *
 * ......
 *
