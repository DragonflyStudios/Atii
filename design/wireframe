 * The following defines the Christmas version 
 *
 * [x] No ActionBar
 * [x] Differentiate Playback and Playout UIs
 *     [x] For now, hard code the difference; in the future ... could introduce "group" property for "command buttons"

 *     [ ] Fix crashing on Nexus 7
 *     [ ] Device rotation  & orientation handling
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Page operations
 *     [ ] When story is empty automatically create a blank page
 *     [ ] Add page after
 *     [ ] Add page before
 *     [ ] Delete page
 * [ ] Need a bit of "file format"
 *     - Use an XML file for list of pages, with each item in the list pointing to a file
 *     - Still honors the one-image-one-audio policy.
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] HTML5 starts
 * [ ] Generate time-lapse videos
 *
 * ......
 * 
 * [ ] GridView showing previews and titles of Stories for StoryListActivity
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Should seriously consider using other apps for photo capture
 *     [ ] Or maybe adapt from the built-in Camera app? 
 * [ ] Should seriously consider using other apps for audio recording
 * [ ] Add UI for using any image on device (copy over) -- allow panning, zooming & cropping.
 * [ ] Add UI for using any audio on device (copy over) -- is this a good idea?
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Google Drive integration -- This starts the sharing business
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Gingerbread support
 * [ ] Kindle Fire test
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] Usability features
 *     [ ] Fading: during playback, controls disappear after a certain delay (e.g. 5 seconds); otherwise stays
 *     [ ] Show draggable progress bar.
 *         [ ] For audio?
 *         [ ] For pages: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us8w2g9YXC4&feature=youtube_gdata
 *     [ ] Make buttons translucent & pretty
 *         [ ] Needs a designer
 *     [ ] When recording --
 *         [ ] Hide all buttons (currently shows a Stop button)
 *         [ ] Superimpose translucent equalizer/volume feedback
 *             - See: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-developers/QVqlE--SkoA
 *             -      http://developer.samsung.com/android/technical-docs/Displaying-Sound-Volume-in-Real-Time-While-Recording
 *         [ ] Double tap to stop recording
 *     Future Consideration:
 *         [ ] During recording, single tap anywhere to zoom in (x2) and in zoom-in tap anywhere to zoom out
 *             [ ] When play back, such transformations will be timed to the audio ...
 *             - Note that this breaks the one-page-one-audio correspondence; or at least could break it.
 *
 * ......
 *
 * [ ] PDF as source of page image
 *     - THINK: how easy it would be for people to make a narrated presentation.
 *
 * Future: [ ] Capturing while recording audio?
