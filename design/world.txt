The "world" is about the "lay" of the "land".

Implementation --

- A "world.xml" file specifies the land
-- The dimensions of the world
-- The list of photos (and videos), their dimensions, their whereabouts, (and their whenabouts?)
-- The list of audios (and their whenabouts?)

{- Time, place [+ orientation], auditory, visual, tactile ...}

- A "story.xml" file specifies the story telling over the "land" by specifying "clips" in terms of
-- "looks" of photos, and
-- "listens" of audios
--- referencing photos and audios? or reference place & time?
-- clip transitions ...
