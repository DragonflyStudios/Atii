Each book corresponds to a folder, which may or may not contain the following:

(1) a file named "book.xml"
    - if the file is present and non-empty, then the content of this file is used
    - if the file is not present or is empty, then the following is used as the default content
      -- and "book.xml" will be rewritten with this content

~~~ The following is an illustration of the format of book.xml ~~~

<!-- a book has a title and zero or more authors -->

<book>
    <title>This book has no title</title>
    <author>Dr. Seuss</author>
    <author>Dr. Strangelove</author>
</book>


(2) a file named "preview.png"
    - if the file is present, it is then used as the preview image for the book
    - if the file is not present, a preview will be generated from the image for the first page of the book
    - if there is no page image available, a default "empty book" preview is used


(3) a "pages.xml" file that contains a list of pairs of page image files and audio files

~~~ The following is an illustration of the format of pages.xml ~~~

<!-- a book contains zero or more pages -->
<pages>
    <!-- each page may contain zero or one image and zero or one audio -->
    <page>
        <image>p1.jpg</image>
        <audio>a1.3gp</audio>
    </page>
    <page>
        <audio>blahblahblah.3gp</audio>
    </page>
    <page></page>
    <page>
        <image>page.jpg</image>
    <page>
</pages>

~~~ end of illustration ~~~

NOTE:

- for now the # of pages will be induced from counting the number of pages.
- When displaying the pages, any page that misses image will be substituted by a default "empty page" image
- When playing the audios, pages that do not have audio will show a no-audio icon, at least in "authoring" mode

(4) a folder named "images" under which the page images are stored

(5) a folder named "audios" under which the default/stock/"authoritative" audios are stored


=== Future ==>

[ ] Allow more than one "players" or "readers" ... each of whom could have a dedicated audio folder
    - we can use a "readers.xml" file to track these readers and their corresponding audio folder
    - and have a UI to switch among them ...
[ ] NOTE also: we could allow zero or more illustrations/images per page ...
    - We could do two things symmetrically: text and image
      - we could also run "atii writing" competition, where given illustrations, people come up with text
      - we could also run "atii illustrating" competition, where given text, people come up with illustrations/images
    - Where we have both text and image
      - we could run "atii reading" competition, where given a book, people compete in performing well
